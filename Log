Day 5: July 6, 2023 Thursday

Today's Progress: This day, I did take the simple survey form certification, I dont know if it is really a certification tho because the certification
is pure html and i cant find any challenge doing it. After that, I did take the next course which is the learning the CSS box model by making a Rothko Painting. 
I learned about CSS box Model, the overflow hidden technique, margin, and padding.

Thoughts: I did learn everything from the course, but i didnt really understand the CSS box modeling thoroughly because the free code camps course is not 
really beginner friendly that it teaches you the basics of it like other learning websites like w3school. I guess I have to do some little research.
