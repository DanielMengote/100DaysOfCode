Today's Progress: even though I already have basic understanding about Html and CSS, I decided to complete the HTML Course in Free Code Camp. To my surprise, I realized that I missed some of 
the most imout some of the important Html tags that is mostly used. However after the course, I managed to learn some of the things and concepts that i missed learning in other tutorials that i took.

Thoughts: I really struggled with CSS, but, overall, I feel like I am slowly getting better at it. Canvas is still new for me, but I managed to figure out some basic functionality.

Day 3: June 27, Monday
Today's Progress: I have made a 3 Simple Colored Marker using CSS. I have learned different ways of coloring using hex, rgb, and hsl. One more thing that i learned 
from the lesson is the linear-gradient which is for me a great css property to use in styling as it produce linear-gradient color which you can navigate and change
color base on what you want. 

Thoughts I've recently started coding, and it's a great feeling when I finally solve an algorithm challenge after a lot of attempts and hours spent.
